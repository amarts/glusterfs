.TH GlusterFS 8 "Clustered File System" "07 March 2011" "Gluster Inc."
.SH NAME
GlusterFS \- clustered file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B glusterfs
.I [options] [mountpoint]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
GlusterFS is a clustered file system, capable of scaling to several peta-bytes.
It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP and
interconnect into one large parallel network file system. Storage bricks can
be made of any commodity hardware, such as x86-64 server with SATA-II RAID and
Infiniband HBA.

GlusterFS is fully POSIX compliant file system. On client side, it has dependency
on FUSE package, on server side, it works seemlessly on different operating systems. Currently supported on GNU/Linux and Solaris.
